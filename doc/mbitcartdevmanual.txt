Master-Bit Fantasy Console Cartridge Development Manual

All lua files made for use with Master-Bit should contain two user defined global functions, mbitSettings and mbitLoop.
mbitSettings gets called once by Master-Bit after loading the lua file and has no arguments or results.
mbitLoop gets called by Master-Bit's main loop, and gets passed user input as an integer argument and returns no result.
The current format of the input integer is to set each of the six least significant bits to 1 if its associated key is down.
The keys are c for the least significant bit, then z, up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, and right arrow.

The mbit lua library currently contains three functions, listed below.

mbit.settitle( string )
Sets a line of up to 32 chars to be printed to the top center of the screen. Suggested to be used for program title.

mbit.setauthor( string )
Sets a line of up to 32 chars to be printed to the bottom center of the screen. Suggested to be used for author name.

mbit.setline( integer, integer, string )
Sets a line to be printed to one of three areas of the screen, in one of sixteen positions.
The first integer can be 0, 1, or 2. The second integer can be 0 through 15.
Area 0 is the left info area with a max string length of 14 chars.
Area 2 is the right info area with a max string length of 14 chars.
Area 1 is the play area with a max string length of 32 chars.
The play area is 320 by 320 pixels and will also later be used for graphics.
